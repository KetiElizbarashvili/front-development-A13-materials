1. JavaScript Overview
What is JavaScript?
A high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
Integral to web development, enabling interactive and dynamic content.
Conforms to the ECMAScript specification.


2. Variables and Data Types
Variables (var, let, const)
Containers for storing data values.
var: Function-scoped or globally-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared.
const: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared.
Data Types
Primitive: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol.
Non-primitive: Objects (including Arrays, Functions).


3. Operators
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, etc.
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --.
Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=.
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !.


4. Control Structures
Conditional Statements: if, else, switch.
Loops: for, while, do-while, for...in, for...of.


5. Functions
Function Definition and Invocation
Types of Functions: Regular functions, Arrow functions, Anonymous functions.
Scope and Closure


6. Objects and Arrays
Object Basics: Properties, Methods.
Arrays: Methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, forEach, map.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)


7. DOM Manipulation
What is the DOM?
Selecting Elements: getElementById, querySelector.
Modifying Elements: Changing text, HTML, styles.
Event Handling: Adding event listeners, event propagation.


8. Asynchronous JavaScript
Callbacks
Promises
Async/Await


9. Error Handling
try...catch
throwing Errors


10. Best Practices
Code Readability
Avoiding Global Variables

11. ES6 and Beyond
New Features: Arrow functions, Template literals, Destructuring, Default parameters, Spread/rest operator, Classes, Modules.


12. Web APIs and HTTP
Understanding APIs
Making HTTP Requests: XMLHttpRequest, fetch.


13. Frameworks and Libraries
Popular Libraries: jQuery.
Frameworks: Angular, React, Vue.js.


14. Development Tools
Debugging: Browser DevTools.
Linting: ESLint.
Build Tools: Webpack, Babel.
